Description: 
        Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
        is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However,
        few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are
        non-trivial to code by hand. ``pymc`` is a python package that implements the
        Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a python class, and is extremely
        flexible and applicable to a large suite of problems. ``pymc`` includes
        methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and convergence
        diagnostics.
        
        ``pymc`` only requires ``NumPy``. All other dependencies such as ``matplotlib``,
        ``SciPy``, ``pytables``, ``sqlite`` or ``mysql`` are optional.
